## Why did you leave?
 
I recently got some results through my University degree that weren't what I needed to continue on with the course I was wanting to do, which meant that I could not continue on with my education and put me in a very tight situation. This is the one and only time i've been in such a situation where I actually questioned my life. For me to find out what my next step was, I needed to leave the clan for a while whilst I sorted out some stuff and got myself back up and attempted to solve this mess.
 
## When will you be back?
 
After figuring out my life and having some time away from the clan to focus on that, I finally came up with a plan and have been to University again and had interviews etc. I will be continuing my education at University, but it will take me a bit longer. I will be resuming my position as Admin in around 2 weeks, but with that, I won't be around as much as I used to. I have a lot of other things that I now need to work on. I'll be setting up some stuff to help with me using the time I spend in the clan wisely and meaning that the time I do spend here will be used productively and also so you guys still have me to talk to.
 
## So whats new?
 
This is for me to work on and I will let you know of what needs to be done in order for me to focus on my education and still enable me to give you the full experience you deserve in the JamOORev. I will be working closely with Orange on setting some new stuff up that will help us give the JamOORev its old spark.
 
Thanks for you understanding
Kroos, your one true admin.

### P.S
 
I'm sorry that i left so abruptly, but it was needed. I've not been feeling myself for the past few months, so hopefully with me splitting up my RL and the clan, will help me get back to the way i was.
