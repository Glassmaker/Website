The OOClan was created in 2011, as a community of 7 members who were all friends at the same college in Yorkshire, England:

- Kris1432
- eddie900
- Birrellmeister
- pandab3rr
- Becki987
- Oobihaxorz
- BradXD1995

In the very beginning, Eddie opened a server up a vanilla minecraft server, rented from a company called “Servercraft“. At this point, we had all just started playing minecraft and on this server we would alternate from Survival to Creative building, just basically doing what the Vanilla minecraft users do today.

In 2012 we discovered modded minecraft (through the Tekkit craze that was going on).  So we had increased the server specification with the same company in order to play on the modded version of minecraft, due to its nature of requiring more RAM etc. We played the Tekkit Classic pack for a while, with a couple extra friends joining in on the fun.

I (Kris) had discovered Feed The Beast (FTB) through watching YouTube videos after around 6 months of us playing Tekkit. So we then moved onto Minecraft 1.4.7 (because modded 1.3.2 wasn't really much of a thing) through the Mindcrack pack on the FTB launcher towards the end of our second year at the college. By the time we had played the pack inside and out, most mods had moved onto Minecraft 1.5 and FTB didn’t have packs for 1.5 out then, so I decided it was time to make my own private pack for us to try out.

By then, a few original members had things in real life to focus on, like college work etc.) so there were only a couple of us playing at a time, mainly me, Eddie and Birrell. Once College had ended, we had all gone our own ways (University or Work) and nobody was running a server so we decided to leave it there. Then during the first few weeks of University, me (Kris) and BradXD1995 decided to try out some new mods in the Minecraft 1.6.x range, plus Brad had not played with mods since Tekkit Classic, so I wanted to show him some new stuff since then.

During this time (and the time that OOClan was dorment), I was using IRC daily to chat about mods with fellow people in the community, mainly in the #thaumcraft IRC chat, where I met the wondrous Tombenpotter where we would talk about his upcoming mod, Electro-Magic Tools. I had taken a lot of interest into this Thaumcraft Addon, so Tom would send me closed beta’s of his mod for me and Brad to try out on our server. Eventually I invited Tom to come play with me and Brad on the server (hosted by ShardGaming, who vanished). After Tom had joined the server, he had decided it was time for us to create our own IRC channel on esper.net, where a bot from the server would connect to the channel, so users on the server could interact with the IRC members without having to open their IRC client (we use EiraIRC, I recommend checking that mod out)

Once Tom had joined, the server had become more than a place for close friends, it had become its own little community. Shortly after Tom was invited to the server, Wasliebob (Author of Thaumcraft Extras) was invited to play through me and Tom. Around a month later, I felt that we had enough resources to occupy a few more members on the server, so I had asked Tom to invite some of his friends that would want to play on the server, Things grew a lot from then, as people such as Udaldor (previously known as IceDrug20), Fuzzy, Siramnot and Mex were invited to play.

Udaldor was friendly with a fellow minecraft modding community member called Lordmau5, whom happened to have his own server at the time, but barely any players. Our server only had 3GB of Ram and was rented from Creeperhost, whereas Lord’s server was hosted by a friend and had 8GB of Ram and a beefier CPU. So after a lot of discussion, we decided to merge server, it costed each of us less and we had a better server out of it. I can’t thank the people (mainly Spirit) at AEG-Gaming enough, they have been amazing and Spirit has been so helpful in setting us up and helping out when possible.

In early 2014, TheDrunkMafia has joined the community, and bringing all of his skill sets with him, if it weren’t for him, you wouldn’t be reading this right now, for there would be not site. DrunkMafia was given Moderator status for being a top member in the community and showing his commitment. He would help out the server where he could, as well as coding his mod; Thaumic Infusion.

In July 14, TheOrangeGenius was assigned Moderator, due to his dedication towards the clan and his epic minecraft skills

After mutual aspirations, we decided to team up with JamCraft to have a bigger community and to help move onto bigger and better things. 

### Why the name OOClan?

The most asked question I get… The Clan bit is simple, but where is this OO thing from. Basically, the word “stoof” was used throughout the internet (mainly Runescape), which meant “stuff”. Eddie decided to use that OO in stoof and use it on his fellow members usernames. So Kris would be Kroos, the OO would go where it would make sense upon being spoken. Try it on your own username. When tom asked what I wanted the IRC channel name to be, I had to think of something, and this was the best thing I could come up with at the time. So there you have it, OOClan explained.
