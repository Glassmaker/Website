JamCraft started in December 2013 after ModJam 3 with a community of 16 modders/testers:

- allout58
- ChewBaker
- domi1819
- founderio
- isomgirls6 (kkaylium)
- jmjmjm439
- Joban
- KJ4IPS
- Mitchellbrine
- MrComputerGhost
- MrKol999
- Resinresin
- sci4me
- soar1n (TheDarkKnight)
- theminecoder (hawks008)
- YSPilot

We set up a testing server for ours and other ModJam mods. KJ had set up a Jenkins that would update our pack automagically using Gradle. 

Skip ahead 5 months, and we come to ModJam 4. Those of us from before would hang out and help each other out during ModJam 4 in the ModJam TeamSpeak. After ModJam 4 we gained a few new friends and we just kept modding together. 

About 3 months later, in August of 2014, poppypoppop introduced us to the [OOClanners](about-ooclan.html) and we decided to take over (or join forces), creating the [JamOORevolution](about.html) as it is today.

Just thought I'd put this in here. Just cause About OOClan had one.

### Why the name JamCraft?

While conceiving the idea of a giant modpack to test our mods, some of us tried coming up with names, eventually Mitchellbrine came up with the name JamCraft and it kind of stuck.

<!--- (My computer was wiped clean not too long after, so I don't have a log of this name idea creation -Mitchell)  Someone insert some names we had. I really don't have any record. -->
